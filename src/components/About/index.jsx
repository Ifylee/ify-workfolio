          I caught fire coding.</p>
          <p>
          Who could have imagined I'd become a coder? Born and raised in Nigeria, I earned my undergraduate degree in French and began a rewarding career as a Sales Manager for an underwater engineering company. This role allowed me to travel to countries like Taiwan, Switzerland, France, and Germany, blending professional development with adventure. </p>
          <p>
          In 2017, I visited America, where unexpected twists reshaped my life. I fell in love, got married, and started a new chapter as a wife. My career took off as a customer service representative, and within three months, I was promoted to Shipping Supervisor.</p>
         <p>
          During maternity leave, an ad for Codecademy caught my attention, sparking my journey into coding. I’ll never forget the moment I wrote my first line of code—"Hello, world." It felt magical as if I were the magician creating something extraordinary. That moment sparked an inextinguishable fire in me, awakening a passion for creating and problem-solving. All I wanted to do was code, code, code, code!</p>
          <p>
          Motivated by my newfound passion, I enrolled in Codecademy’s full program and completed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses. I discovered that coding is like solving puzzles—each piece fitting into a grand vision. The satisfaction of building apps gave me a sense of empowerment: "If I want it, I can build it. Period!"</p>
          <p>
          To solidify my knowledge, I took a career break and enrolled in UC Berkeley Extension’s 24-week intensive program in web development. It was a transformative journey that equipped me with front-end and back-end development skills and a deep understanding of full-stack technologies. Transitioning from a background in sales and logistics to information technology has been challenging, but it’s also what makes me unique. I bring a wealth of experience in customer service, communication, sales, and time management—skills that complement my technical expertise. 
          I am excited to combine these strengths to create meaningful solutions and add value wherever I go.
